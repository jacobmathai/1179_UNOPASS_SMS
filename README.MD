About 				: A user authentication protocol named Unopass which leverages a user’s cellphone and short message service to thwart password stealing and password reuse attacks. Unopass only requires each participating website possesses a unique phone number and involves a telecommunication service provider in registration and recovery phases. Through Unopass, users only need to remember a long-term password for login on all websites. After evaluating the Unopass prototype, we believe Unopass is efficient and affordable compared with the conventional web authentication mechanisms.
